# FractalLearn
# 🌳 FractalLearn – Visual Mathematics for STEM Education

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Many students find mathematics abstract and difficult to visualize.
Concepts like recursion, ratios, and angles are taught theoretically,
without showing how they appear in nature.

## 💡 Solution
FractalLearn is a Python-based educational tool that visualizes
mathematical concepts using fractal trees.
Students can change parameters like ratio and angle to see
how mathematical rules control natural growth patterns.

## 🧠 Core Concepts Used
- Python Programming
- Recursion
- Ratios & Angles
- Mathematical Modeling
- STEM Visualization

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Pydroid 3 / Google Colab
- Turtle Graphics
- GitHub
